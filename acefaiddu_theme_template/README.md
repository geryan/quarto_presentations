# Beamer theme: ACEFA and IDDU

This repository contains a Beamer theme that uses the ACEFA and IDDU branding.

**Important:** this theme only works with the XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX toolchains.
Unless you have specific requirements, you should use `lualatex` instead of `xelatex`.
This theme will not work with `pdflatex`.
